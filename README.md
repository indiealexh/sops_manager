    proc_result.dart            # Simple wrapper for CLI results
  utils/
    file_path.dart              # Crossâ€‘platform path helper
  widgets/
    public_key_entry_card.dart  # Editor UI for a single key entry
    outputs_panel.dart          # Reusable scrollable output panel

Notes:
- App behavior is unchanged; this is a pure organization refactor for discoverability.
- If you add new pages or services, follow the same folder conventions.
- Desktop entitlements and pubspec dependencies remain as they were.
